- Display prompt
- Working history
- Search and launch right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path)
- At most one global variable
- Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the
subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon)
- Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the
metacharacters in the quoted sequence
- Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the 
metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign)
- Redirections:
	◦ < should redirect input.
	◦ > should redirect output.
	◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
	delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
	◦ >> should redirect output in append mode.
- Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe
- Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values
- Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline
- Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash
- In interactive mode:
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.
- Built in commmands:
	◦ echo with option -n
	◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
	◦ pwd with no options
	◦ export with no options
	◦ unset with no options
	◦ env with no options or arguments
	◦ exit with no options
- The readline() function may cause memory leaks, but you are not required to fix them.
However, this does not mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have
memory leaks.
